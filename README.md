## Project Details

### Data Extraction

- Sourced a comprehensive Netflix user behavior dataset from Kaggle.
- Dataset includes information about user interactions, content preferences, and viewing patterns.

### Data Preprocessing

- Performed data cleaning to ensure data accuracy and consistency.
- Handled missing values, duplicates, and organized the data for analysis.

### Data Analysis

- Utilized NumPy and Pandas for in-depth data analysis.
- Extracted insights into user behavior, engagement patterns, and content popularity.
- Derived meaningful metrics to quantify user preferences and viewing habits.

### Data Visualization

- Utilized Seaborn and Matplotlib to create insightful visualizations.
- Generated bar plots, line charts, heatmaps, and more to illustrate trends and patterns.
- Visualizations provide a clear representation of user engagement, content popularity, and viewing habits.
  
### Usage

- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Open the Jupyter Notebook (`netflix_user_behaviour_analysis.ipynb`) in a compatible environment.
- Follow along with the documented steps to understand the EDA process.
- Experiment with the code and visualizations to gain insights.
- Feel free to modify and adapt the code for your own analysis.
