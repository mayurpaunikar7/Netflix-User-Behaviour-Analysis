## Project Details

### Data Extraction

- Sourced a comprehensive Netflix user behavior dataset from Kaggle.
- Dataset includes information about user interactions, content preferences, and viewing patterns.

### Data Preprocessing

- Performed data cleaning to ensure data accuracy and consistency.
- Handled missing values, duplicates, and organized the data for analysis.

### Data Analysis

- Utilized NumPy and Pandas for in-depth data analysis.
- Extracted insights into user behavior, engagement patterns, and content popularity.
- Derived meaningful metrics to quantify user preferences and viewing habits.

### Data Visualization

- Utilized Seaborn and Matplotlib to create insightful visualizations.
- Generated bar plots, line charts, heatmaps, and more to illustrate trends and patterns.
- Visualizations provide a clear representation of user engagement, content popularity, and viewing habits.
  
### Usage

- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Open the Jupyter Notebook (`netflix_user_behaviour_analysis.ipynb`) in a compatible environment.
- Follow along with the documented steps to understand the EDA process.
- Experiment with the code and visualizations to gain insights.
- Feel free to modify and adapt the code for your own analysis.

## Challenges Faced

- **Data Variety**: Handling diverse data types, including numerical, date-based, and categorical, posed data preprocessing challenges.

- **Data Volume**: Analyzing a large dataset required efficient memory management and processing techniques.

- **Data Quality**: Addressing missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies was critical for accurate analysis.

## Insights Derived

- **Churn Rate**: Calculated the churn rate by analyzing the drop in user subscriptions over time, revealing trends and potential reasons for churn.

- **User Segmentation**: Employed clustering techniques to segment users based on their viewing habits, facilitating targeted content recommendations.

- **Geographical Trends**: Analyzed user demographics and behavior by country, unveiling regional preferences and opportunities.

## Future Scope

- **Personalized Recommendations**: Implement machine learning algorithms to provide personalized content recommendations, enhancing user engagement.

- **Predictive Analytics**: Develop predictive models to forecast user churn and take proactive measures to retain subscribers.

- **A/B Testing**: Conduct A/B tests to optimize user interface, content placement, and marketing strategies for better user experiences.

- **Data Security**: Strengthen data security measures to protect user information and comply with evolving data privacy regulations.
